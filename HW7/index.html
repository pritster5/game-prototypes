            </li>

            <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
                While the general gameplay is based off of classic top-down fundamentals, the various additions I've made give the game some extra originality. 
                The theme of playing as an immune system is not one that I've seen before and the upgrades are all original as well. 
            </li>

            <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
                The gameplay of shooting enemies to disable their movement and overlapping with them to kill them is something I haven't seen and should add some interesting tension.
                This is because enemies move past you while you come forward to kill disabled enemies.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
                Making solid top-down shooter mechanics required a LOT of time. 
                The easiest part was the art, since I have gotten faster over the semester at making pixel art. The hardest part was the coding in a class based format as the Phaser 3 API si very hard to read and it so broad.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
                Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
                <ul>
                    <li>All art assets were made by me except for the lungs at the bottom of the screen. Menu music is by Brandon Morris</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>             
                My game follows basic top-down shooter mechanics so it looks similar to many other top down shooters. 
                I used the top-down shooter Phaser 3 example to see how to implement a lot of the game mechanics I used.
            </li>

            <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
                Defend against waves of the coronavirus and defeat everything it throws at you.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
                To see if the core shooting mechanics are solid and that player movement is fluid and responsive.

                ADDED ON ITERATION 2: To see if the delayed ammo pickup logic adds enjoyable tension to the game and 
                to see if the new enemy wave spawn logic provides a smooth ramping up in the difficulty curve.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
                Like any good shooter, the thrill is in the challenge. I want players to have fun trying to react quickly enough to the ever increasing onslaught of the various enemies spawned.
            </li>
                
            <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
                Since this is the first part, most of the proposed game features have not been implemented.
                The only thing I have right now is the moving and shooting mechanics that disable then kill the enemies as well as basic enemy spawning (which will be vastly improved in the next iteration).

                GAMEPLAY RULES: You need to mark the bacteria before you can kill them. Once you hit them with antibodies they will freeze, at which point you can go over them to kill them for good.
                WASD for directional movement and use the mouse to point and click to shoot antibodies. 
                Press Escape or Q to unlock your mouse cursor out of the game window.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
                Moving around constantly is the only sure way to make sure you dont let any viruses or bacteria sneak past.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
                The year is 2020. A deadly virus known as COVID-19 breaks out and humanity is being overrun with illness. For some reason however, there's one dude who just can't seem to get infected. 
                It happens to be due to his exceptional immune system that fights incredibly hard to stave of COVID-19. You are that immune system. Fight hard and you may overcome COVID-19 once and for all.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
                All gamers, particularly young children who could learn about the names of various parts of the immune system. 
            </li>

            <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
                With all the features implemented and all waves completed, it could take up to 5 minutes.
            </li>
