# Game Prototypes | Prithvi Boinpally

This repository contains all of your games as well as a few simple "hello, world!"
templates for a game made with Phaser.
This repository should be marked as GitHub Pages. This lets you run your games directly from github!
Check it out: [https://pritster5.github.io/game-prototypes/](https://pritster5.github.io/game-prototypes/)

You can't run the `index.html` for a Phaser game directly from your local machine without a local webserver.
If you try, the images won't load (your browser will prevent it, thinking it is malicious).
To get around this with Python, simply enter the directory and type `python -m http.server`.
Once you have your local server running, browse to it using Chrome: [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
